## Agenda

### Model Part

* Data Relationships
	* one to one
	* one to many
		* In document
        * Separate document
	* many to many
    * EXERCISE: Whiteboard Data Modelling

* Related Models
	* ObjectId
	* Prefer children referencing parent ids
	* ObjectId refâ€™s
    * EXERCISE: Create Models
	* Sub Documents
		* logical Mongoose constructs
		* don't use unless you really need it

			* Break apart very large document
        * Consider shared JS instead
    * Discriminators
* Using mongoose `.select` and `.populate`
* Restrict number of results with `.limit()` and `.skip()`
* Mongoose document objects
	* Wrapper around data
	* performance considerations
	* use `.lean()`
    * EXERCISE: Use `select`, `lean` and `populate`
* Augmenting Models with methods
	* static
	* instance
