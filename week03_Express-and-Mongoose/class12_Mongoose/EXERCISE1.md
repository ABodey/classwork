1. Design schema and validation:
    * schema, with at least one:
        * string and number
        * object
        * array
    * Include one default value
    * validation (will implement in exercise 2):
        * `required`
        * `enum`
        * `min` and/or `max` number or string length
1. Write Schema
2. Export Model
3. Import and Write Test
    * Create basic model with all required fields (should pass `validate`)
