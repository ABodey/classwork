## Questions and Issues?

* ?

## Today's Learning Objectives
* Learn to use mongoose to enforce data schema and
validate data

### Mongoose
* use `npm i mongoose -S` (no need for `mongodb`)
* Mongoose Schemas
	* Defining “Properties” (aka paths)
		* Types and property options
		* How to nest
			* Arrays: inside `[]` is example type of this array
	* Turn into models...
	* Testing models
    * **EXERCISE 1**: Make a tested model
	* Validation:
    	* required
		* `enum`
		* validation...
    * **EXERCISE 2**: Tested model validation
* Consuming models in routes
    * Connecting - look at in class example
    * Differences from raw mongodb drivers:
        * Use `mongoose` in requires and for creating the connection
        * No `ObjectID` required
        * No `toArray` or `res.ops[0]`
        * Additional static methods: `findById` and friends
        * Adds a `__v` prop
	* Static model methods (`Model.findOne()`)
	* instance models (`model.save()`)
	* Additional modifiers:
		* `select`
		* `lean`
		* `where`
		* `count`
    * Testing mongodb
        * Running test server for use in e2e testing
        * Preparing resources for testing
    * **EXERCISE 3:** Tested express routes with Mongoose
* More Schema Options
	* timestamp
