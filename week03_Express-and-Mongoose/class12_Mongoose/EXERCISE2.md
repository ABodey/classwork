Add Validation (Schema or Test first - your choice "Test Now")
* Schema
    * `required`
    * `enum`
    * `min` and/or `max` number or string length
    * Bonus: custom validation
4. Add Failed Validation Test
    * Combine as many validation errors as makes sense
    * `validate()` is _expected_ to fail
