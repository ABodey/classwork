Implement `.push` and `.shift` without any helper methods (use only `arr.length`, `arr[n]`, and `arr[n] = value`)


Implement `.pop` and `.unshift` without any helper methods (use only `arr.length`, `arr[n]`, and `arr[n] = value`)


Implement `Stack` as an abstract data type (`class` that has an array property) that exposes:
* `push()`
* `pop()`
* `peek()`


Implement `Queue` as an abstract data type (`class` that has an array property) that exposes:
* `queue()`
* `dequeue()`
* `hasNext()`
BONUS: Can you make it `O(1)`?


Write a function that takes an array, and reverses the array "in-place" (modify the passed in array) by **using a Stack**

* do not use array.reverse!!!
* use the hypothetical `Stack` class
